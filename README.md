# Face-Mesh
.............
The face mesh is a 3D model of a face. It works in combination with the face tracker in Meta Spark the Studio to create a surface that reconstructs someone expressions and show the face. Once you've added a face tracker and face mesh to your project you can create mask effects, add retouching or change the shape of the face.
